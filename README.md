# Inventory System

This repository provides an example of class structure similar to the one used in the Pizza Restaurant project. This structure is not as complex, but it has similar ideas and the Main has some similar input processing. Use it as a reference when working on your project.

Stock and its subclasses are similar to the Pizza class and its subclasses. The Inventory class is similar to the Order and Restaurant classes.
